Gullydeckel2 chess playing program

DESCRIPTION 

Gullydeckel2 is a chess playing program. I personally use it under 
Windows 2000 and Debian Linux 2.2. It is mostly used  together with
a graphical chess board, as a "winboard engine" or "xboard engine". 

You can use it on the command line as well (for solving batches of 
test positions or the like). Type 'gully2 -h' for command line options
or type 'help' interactively at Gully's prompt.

TIMESCALE

A first version -- Gullydeckel 1 -- has been written in 1994/1995. 
Gullydeckel 2 (this program) has been done mainly in 1996, but I 
recently (in 2000) have picked it up again. In 2002/2003,
I worked on support of Win32 plattforms, added support for analysis,
ponder, winboard protocol version 2 and chessbase mode etc. 

AUTHOR

Gullydeckel has been written by myself, Martin Borriss. Since I have
been an novice chess programmer at the time, many a hint from the
chess programmer community (most notably Bruce Moreland and Robert
Hyatt) has been extremely helpful.  

LICENSING 

Gullydeckel has been put under the GNU General Public License. See the
file named "GPL".  It is available for download via the WWW. You are
welcome to send me patches, ideas etc.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

1. Linux

Linux has been the primary platform. I recommend using XBoard 4.2.x as
graphical interface. Nowadays, I run the test suites under Linux. If
you like to do that as well I will be very happy to provide you test
scripts, earlier results etc.

Linux chess database "scid": Todo. I would like to have feedback whether
there is a real need.

2. Windows (Win95, 98, ME, Win2000, XP)

People use Winboard as GUI, other GUIs have been reported to
work. I used it with Fritz8 with the UCI to Winboard adapter as well.

Almost all tournaments are played with the windows version.

Feedback (in particular bug reports) is always appreciated, see also 
the gully.log logfile.
