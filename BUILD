How to build Gullydeckel

You can build Gullydeckel from the supplied C source code. It is
trivial to do for Linux and easy for other Unix systems. I recently
merged the changes neccessary to build it for Win32-based systems.

(1) LINUX

1. Extract the sources from the archive 
(e.g., "tar zxf g2_2.13.pl6.tgz")

2. "cd src"

3. "make" (This gives you the gully2 binary.)

4. To have the opening book available, copy the file "book.bin" into
the directory where the binary resides. (This is the place and
filename searched by default.)

5. Now you are ready to go. You can solve testsuites (in epd/fen
format) by typing something like 

"gully2 -f ../Tests/bk.epd --time 30" 

or play a game using Xboard (e.g., "xboard -fcp gully2"). 

Have fun.

(2) WINDOWS

Dann Corbit started to build Win32 versions in 2000. I realized that
the vast majority of people uses the winboard version, I finally
managed to merge the Windows and Linux sources, so you can build them
as well. I did (with Visual C .net), this binary is supplied.

If you encounter problems, tell me.
