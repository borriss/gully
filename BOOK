How to build to your own opening book with Gullydeckel

The code to build a book is derived from Bob Hyatt's Crafty program. 
This means two things:
* It works quite good.
* It is particulary easy to use if you know how to build a book with crafty.

Here are the steps:
(1) You need a collection of games in PGN (assume it is named
"mygames.pgn"). They should not have comments in it, the parser skips
the remainder of a game then.
(2) Rename book.bin, it will get overwritten.
(2) Start gully2 on a command line. 
(3) At the prompt, type "book admin"
(4) The program again waits for input, type "create mygames.pgn"
(5) Now, Gully will create a new book.bin file from your file "mygames.pgn". Done.

There a lots of more advanced options to customize the book. Look into
book.c for details. I added the option to define a certain player
whose moves the program tries to imitate.
